# Full Stack Projects
Intro & Brainstorm

--
## Thinking Ahead to Job Search
The job search is just a couple of weeks away!
* You’ll be expected to take more and more ownership of projects and time
* Strike system will change -- more details to come

--
## The Full Stack Project
Do:
* Make it polished and professional
* Create a demo account/guest login
* Find and fix all bugs
* Test on multiple browsers and platforms
* Keep a written log of your bugs and development process
* Adequately seed your database
* Have a minimum viable product (MVP) by end of W9D5

--
## The Full Stack Project
Don't:
* Let your heroku dynos sleep
* Make a confusing non-standard UI
* Include inappropriate seed data
* Force users to create an account
* Bury cool features
